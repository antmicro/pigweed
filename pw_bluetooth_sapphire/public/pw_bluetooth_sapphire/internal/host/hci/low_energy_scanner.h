  //   process of being stopped, or the controller does not support discovery,
  //   etc.
  //
  //   - Synchronously returns true if the procedure was initiated but the it is
  //   unknown whether or not the procedure has succeeded.
  //
  //   - |callback| is invoked asynchronously to report the status of the
  //   procedure. In the case of failure, |callback| will be invoked once to
  //   report the end of the procedure. In the case of success, |callback| will
  //   be invoked twice: the first time to report that the procedure has
  //   started, and a second time to report when the procedure ends, either due
  //   to a timeout or cancellation.
  //
  //   - |period| specifies (in milliseconds) the duration of the scan. If the
  //   special value of kPeriodInfinite is passed then scanning will continue
  //   indefinitely and must be explicitly stopped by calling StopScan().
  //   Otherwise, the value must be non-zero.
  //
  // Once started, a scan can be terminated at any time by calling the
  // StopScan() method. Otherwise, an ongoing scan will terminate at the end of
  // the scan period if a finite value for |period| was provided.
  //
  // During an active scan, scannable advertisements are reported alongside
  // their corresponding scan response. Every scannable advertisement is stored
  // and not reported until either
  //
  //   a) a scan response is received
  //   b) an implementation determined timeout period expires
  //   c) for periodic scans, when the scan period expires
  //
  // Since a passive scan involves no scan request/response, all advertisements
